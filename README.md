> **Briefly describe the purpose of this project here.** What spatial problem does this solve? Who is the end user? What data does it produce?

## Repository Structure

This project follows the standard TDF GIS template structure to keep data, exploration, and production code completely separated:

```text
├── data/
│   ├── processed/         # Cleaned, derived, or finalized spatial data
│   └── raw/               # Original, unaltered spatial downloads (DO NOT COMMIT to Git)
├── docs/
├── notebooks/             # Jupyter Notebooks for spatial exploration and prototyping
├── scripts/               # Production-ready Python or Node.js scripts
├── .env.example           # Template for local environment variables and secrets
├── .gitignore             # Standard GIS ignore rules (blocks massive spatial binaries)
├── AGENTS.md              # AI Coding Agent constraints and rules for TDF
├── README.md              # Project documentation (You are here!)
└── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies (pandas, geopandas, arcgis, etc.)
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine (e.g., `C:\github\[project-name]`). Do not clone into a OneDrive-synced folder like `Documents` to avoid sync conflicts.

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
**Never commit actual credentials to GitHub.**
1. Create a copy of `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`.
2. Fill in your required credentials (e.g., AGOL Username, AGOL Password, API Keys) locally. 

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required libraries to run this project:

```sh
# To install only the core production dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# To install all development tools (like JupyterLab) as well:
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Data Handling Rules

1. **Large Spatial Files:** Do not commit `.shp`, `.gdb`, `.tif`, or any large spatial binaries to this repository.
2. **Raw Data:** Store all raw downloads in `data/raw/`. Treat this folder as read-only.
3. **Outputs:** Write all cleaned, intermediate, and final spatial outputs to `data/processed/`.

## AI Agent Compatibility

This repository is pre-configured to work seamlessly with TDA's AI coding assistants and enterprise models.
* Please refer to `AGENTS.md` for specific instructions on how agents should interact with this codebase.
* **Crucial Note:** Local shell executions are blocked by Enterprise Group Policy. Agents must rely entirely on direct file read/write operations and cannot run terminal commands to verify edits.
